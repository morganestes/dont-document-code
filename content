Building a Membership Site on WordPress
It's totally doable&hellip;
&hellip;but there are some things to watch for:
<h4>Concerns:</h4>
1)&nbsp;Separation of members and staff
2)&nbsp;Protection of pages and posts
<i>Custom post types are often unhandled</i>
3)&nbsp;Drip content
4)&nbsp;Caching
Best for logged-out users
Can get in the way of permissions and logins
5)&nbsp;Integration with sales systems
Handle recurring payments that provide monthly access
<h4>Plugin options:</h4>
1)&nbsp;Directly tied to an external system
2)&nbsp;Standalone that handles all functions
3)&nbsp;Extensions for ecommerce plugins
